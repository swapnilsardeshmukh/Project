Because it is a bit inconvenient to operate on IEnumerable<T>, you could make use of immediate
execution. For example, rather than returning IEnumerable<string>, you could simply return a string[],
provided that you transform the sequence to a strongly typed array. Consider this new method of the
Program class, which does this very thing:


static string[] GetStringSubsetAsArray()
{
string[] colors = {"Light Red", "Green",
"Yellow", "Dark Red", "Red", "Purple"};

var theRedColors = from c in colors
where c.Contains("Red") select c;
// Map results into an array.
return theRedColors.ToArray();
}
