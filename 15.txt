The Union() method, as you would guess, returns a result set that includes all members of a batch of
LINQ queries. Like any proper union, you will not find repeating values if a common member appears
more than once. Therefore, the following method will print out the values “Yugo”, “Aztec”, “BMW”, and
“Saab”:
static void DisplayUnion()
{
List<string> myCars = new List<String> { "Yugo", "Aztec", "BMW" };
List<string> yourCars = new List<String> { "BMW", "Saab", "Aztec" };
// Get the union of these containers.
var carUnion = (from c in myCars select c)
.Union(from c2 in yourCars select c2);
Console.WriteLine("Here is everything:");
foreach (string s in carUnion)
Console.WriteLine(s); // Prints all common members.
}
