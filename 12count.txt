Obtaining Counts Using Enumerable
When you are projecting new batches of data, you may need to discover exactly how many items have
been returned into the sequence. Any time you need to determine the number of items returned from a
LINQ query expression, simply make use of the Count() extension method of the Enumerable class. For
example, the following method will find all string objects in a local array that have a length greater than
six characters:
static void GetCountFromQuery()
{
string[] currentVideoGames = {"Morrowind", "Uncharted 2",
"Fallout 3", "Daxter", "System Shock 2"};
// Get count from the query.
int numb =
(from g in currentVideoGames where g.Length > 6 select g).Count();

// Print out the number of items.
Console.WriteLine("{0} items honor the LINQ query.", numb);
}
